# Student Grades Management System

This program manages student grades. It allows users to:

1. **Add a student**: Input the student's name, subjects, and grades.
2. **Display all students**: Show a list of students with their grades, average, and pass/fail status.
3. **Search by name**: Find a student by name and display their details.
4. **Exit**: Exit the program.

It calculates the average grade and checks if the student has passed (average >= 60). The menu-driven system runs until the user chooses to exit.
